monitor-db2-with-nagios
=======================

Welcome to the monitor-db2-with-nagios project!

Here you will find the sources, the wiki, and a bug tracker.

This project aims to provide a set of open source tools to monitor DB2. The
monitoring is limited to control that a value is between a range. The output of
the scripts, allows you to create graphs and see the behavior of the monitored
elements.

Each script is autonomous, it means there are not dependencies between files,
and any modification of the behaviour will be and affect the script.

The template file is provided to create new scripts based on it. It was written
in a way that you just need to fill the TODO with what you want to monitor.

For more information about how to use these scripts, please visit the Wiki:

If you have seen a problem or you have any comments, please feel free to open
an issue and tell us your issue:
